    Scenario: Container starts with single config, new config added later
    
    BEFORE FIX:
    1. Container starts with 0.json as single config
    2. Container starts pre-generating for 0.json (expected) ✓
    3. A new config file 1.json is added (while container is running)
    4. Image for 1.json can be retrieved via API ✓
    5. But 1.json is NEVER scheduled to be updated ✗ (BUG)
    
    AFTER FIX:
    1. Container starts with 0.json as single config
    2. Container starts pre-generating for 0.json (expected) ✓
    3. A new config file 1.json is added (while container is running)
    4. Config watcher detects 1.json was added ✓
    5. Scheduler automatically schedules 1.json with its preGenerateInterval ✓
    6. 1.json is pre-generated immediately ✓
    7. 1.json is updated on its schedule going forward ✓
    
    Implementation:
    - Added fs.watch() to monitor CONFIG_DIR in scheduler/index.js
    - Watch detects 'rename' and 'change' events for .json files
    - Automatically calls scheduleConfigIfNeeded() for new/modified configs
    - Automatically calls stopPreGeneration() for deleted configs
    - 100ms debounce to ensure file writes are complete
